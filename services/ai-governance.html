        AI Governance &amp; Responsible AI is closely linked to strategy, data foundations,
        risk, and operating model decisions. In Truzen engagements, governance is designed
        alongside these dimensions and informed by where you are on the AI Maturity Model
        and how you plan to move through the AI Transformation Framework.
