            sequenced, investable roadmap that is grounded in data readiness,
            governance, and risk expectations.

            Most organizations already have AI activity in motion: pilots, proofs of
            concept, or early production systems. What is often missing is a clear
            view on <em>where to focus next</em>, <em>how to prioritize</em>, and
            <em>what guardrails are needed</em> so AI contributes to outcomes rather
            than creating noise or unmanaged risk.

            Truzen’s AI Strategy work is designed around executive-level questions:
            where does AI create real value, what is realistically feasible given
            your data and operating context, and how should you stage investments
            over the next 12–36 months.
