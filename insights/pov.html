            This page is reserved for Truzen Consulting’s written points of view on AI strategy,
            data strategy, AI governance, risk, and operating models. It is intentionally generic
            at this stage and does not imply that any PoV articles are currently available.

      <p class="tz-muted mb-4">
        Points of View (PoV) articles are intended to be short, structured narratives that clarify
        Truzen’s perspective on specific AI and data topics. They are meant for boards, executives,
        and functional leaders who need concise, governance-aware summaries of complex issues.

                how AI is prioritized, and how roadmaps connect to data and governance.

        This page is configured as the dedicated location for PoV content but does not
        list any actual articles or documents yet. Once topics are finalized and content
        is authored, PoV entries can be added below as cards with titles, short summaries,
        and links to full articles or downloadable formats.

            There are currently no published Points of View in this section. This explicit
            <strong>No data available</strong> state avoids implying that PoV content exists
            behind the scenes. When PoVs are created, this block can be replaced with a
            grid of entries, each with metadata and a link to the full piece.
