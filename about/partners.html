            Partnerships are used to complement, not replace, Truzen’s advisory work.
            The focus is on combining advisory experience with external perspectives,
            education offerings, or domain input where it is valuable for clients.
          </p>
          <p class="tz-muted mb-0">
            Truzen is careful not to overstate partnership scope. Only collaborations
            that are actively in use and clearly defined are referenced here. Additional
            partners will be listed when agreements, scope, and joint activities are
            clearly established.

            Truzen collaborates with the International Institute of AI Governance (IIAIG)
            in areas such as leadership and governance-oriented education related to AI.
            The collaboration is focused on creating shared language between advisory
            work and training content, particularly for executives and governance
            stakeholders.

            Truzen remains an independent advisory firm. IIAIG is an independent body
            focused on AI governance education and professional development. The
            collaboration is designed to ensure that organizations can access both
            advisory support and structured learning pathways where appropriate.
