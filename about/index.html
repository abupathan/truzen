            Truzen Consulting is an advisory practice focused on helping organizations
            navigate AI and data transformation in a way that is both ambitious and governed.
            The work sits at the intersection of strategy, architecture, governance, and risk.
          </p>
          <p class="tz-muted mb-0">
            Rather than treating AI as a purely technical topic, Truzen’s lens includes
            decision-making, accountability, operating models, and the evidence that boards,
            risk committees, and external stakeholders expect. The goal is to make AI
            initiatives executable, explainable, and sustainable over time.

            Truzen’s approach is to work with existing structures rather than around them.
            AI strategy and governance recommendations are shaped to fit each client’s
            operating model, risk appetite, and internal processes.
          </p>
          <p class="tz-muted mb-0">
            Engagements are structured so that internal teams remain in control.

            artefacts, and operating model templates—that can be sustained after the
            advisory work finishes.
