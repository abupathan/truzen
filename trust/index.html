            Responsible AI is not just a list of principles. It is about how AI

            Truzen’s work in this area focuses on helping organizations make
            responsible choices visible, documented, and connected to governance.
          </p>

            We work with strategy, data, technology, and risk teams to translate

            decision records, review checkpoints, roles and responsibilities, and
            artifact templates that can be reused across initiatives.

                Rather than adding more abstract statements, we help teams create
                concrete artefacts—such as impact assessments, decision logs, and

                Governance mechanisms are designed to fit into existing delivery

            AI and data initiatives sit within broader security and compliance

            AI and analytics work rely on data, which often includes information
